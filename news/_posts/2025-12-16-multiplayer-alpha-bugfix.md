It's been exactly one month since we've released the first public version of OpenE2140. The response has been overwhelming — people really enjoyed it, and many multiplayer matches have already been played. After three years of development, it's great to see the game reach a polished state.

You can find download links for the new version on the [Download page]({% link download.html %}).

### Release with bugfixes and small new features

No release is perfect, and a few issues surfaced after the initial launch. This update addresses several of those problems. Here's a quick summary:
`
- Fixed crashes and visual bugs related to the Bantha and` Heavy Lifter units
- Debug menu is now disabled by default
- Defense Tower now requires only a Bio-Center to build (as in E2140)
- Enabled hotkeys for items in the production sidebar
- Updated the engine with additional fixes and improvements

Although these issues are resolved, some known problems remain. For the most up-to-date list, see the [Known issues page]({% link known-issues.md %}).

We've also added a few smaller features:
- Upgraded Power Plant with two additional modules (temporary solution until building upgrades are implemented)
- UCS mechs and T 100 light tank now leave tracks in sand

For a more detailed list of changes, see the [changelog on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenE2140/OpenE2140/releases/release-20251216).

### Next up: basic AI

Our next major focus is AI — the feature we've had the most requests for. We're working hard on a basic AI that will cover:
- base building and technology research
- mining resources
- simple unit tactics
- basic attacking and defending behavior

The first AI alpha won't include advanced tactics or strategy, so don't expect very smart opponent. Keep an eye for future updates.

### Feedback

We're thrilled that OpenE2140 was so well received. We'll keep improving the game, but we still need your feedback — positive or critical. Join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/KNcX5BxA37); we're eager to hear from you!
